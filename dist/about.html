            Hi! Welcome to my About Me Page. My name is Victor Bialek and I'm a
            software developer. I currently work for CADENAS GmbH and handle
            some Backend and Frontend things.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also do some side projects for myself and my friends. Maybe check
            out my work. I'll keep updating this page, when I do more
            interesting things.
          </p>

        <div class="job job-1">
          <h3>Software Developer @ CADENAS GmbH</h3>
          <h6>Software Developer</h6>
          <p>
            My longest software development job to date. It's the one I'm
            currently employed at. I learned much here and the people are great.
            I learned Web Development here and made much progress on my Java and
            C++ programming skills, though to an awesome tech lead I work under.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="job job-2">
          <h3>Fraunhofer Kernkompetenz Zentrum</h3>
          <h6>Student Software Developer</h6>
          <p>
            My first job in software development. I worked with C#/ASP.net. Here
            I realized how important automating things is. Also... it was my
            first software development job. For the first time I could tell my
            ego, that "yes", my skills are actually worth something and I am
            useful with what I've learned so far.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="job job-3">
          <h3>Adriana Beach Club Hotel Resort</h3>
          <h6>Receptionist</h6>
          <p>
            I look fondly back at this time. My first 'real' job. I learned how
            important communication is and how being polite and knowing good
            etiquette can bring you far. I also trained my language skills here.
            I regularly translated many texts for upper management and for our
            guests at the time.
